## Discussion
Timebox: 45 minutes
Continued our discussion from last time regarding what the community feels they are not getting (discussion notes below, Last Meeting 20200908/Discussion):
* What responsibilities does the community want to have?
* What does the community feel like they are missing?
* Are there specific subprojects we can pull from the existing larger repositories that can be built off to facilitate community iteration and improvement?
* Can we define initiatives that the community can collaboratively drive forward?
* Can we nominate key community contributors who have enough experience with a project's codebase to be promoted to merge privileges?

#### Discussion
* What are the milestones that Anaconda is looking to move to a community governance model?
* What can be community-governed?
* Breaking conda-build into smaller parts? Implement as separate projects and adapting them to conda?
* How will the community contribute in the governance model?
    * (ED) Are there definite milestones before Anaconda will shfit to community governance?
* Transparency of decisions?
    * (TO) Need to make clear what are community objetives, what are strictly corporate objectives, and what are a mix of both.
* Anaconda has always been an avid supporter of the conda community and been a great steward of many conda tools to this point. There is a need now for more clarity of which parts of the conda ecosystem can become community governed (community-driven). There are now advocates for conda-build, conda-pack, conda-constructor, and even conda itself to become community-driven.
* Some comments from Travis about how Anaconda employee contributors mostly wear a community hat when they contribute to the conda community and so it can be hard for both sides to understand when that might not be the case.  This can lead to situations where a company like Anaconda that is very supportive of the community can be at the same time "hard to work with" from the community perspective unless there is clarity about which hat people are wearing when they contribute.  It's also why community-governance can become an important issue so that people can trust the project evolves according to the community as a whole and not just particular stake-holders.
* Even if Anaconda decides that one or more of the conda tools must remain as Anaconda-governed for the time being, it would really help to have transparency and communication from Anaconda-as-a-business of project goals, roadmaps, and priorities and have them separated from individual Anaconda employee desires and goals as community members. Travis suspects that most changes are actually driven by Anaconda employees as community members and not because of Anaconda-as-a-business directed work (but it would be great to be able to know this).
