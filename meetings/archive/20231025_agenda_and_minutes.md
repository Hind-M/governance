    - (JK) Need to consider things like ABI stability
        - Buffer protocol API added in Python 3.11 (so need a newer version of Python to start)

        - Potential changes down the road
            - https://discuss.python.org/t/lets-get-rid-of-the-stable-abi-but-keep-the-limited-api/18458/24
    - (JL) ABI4 ðŸ˜± is under discussion by Python core (no-gil variant)
    - (DH) Revisit noarch bugs that make Python upgrades awkward / noarch packages might not wind up properly installed in the new Python?
- [x] (JL) conda-libmamba-solver will be default in conda 23.10.0!
    - Hold on to your hats! ðŸŽ©
    - Release imminent: https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/13156
